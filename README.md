#### Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. 
#### Heart Attack
The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United
States is coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.
#### Chronic Kidney Disease
Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function.
Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. 
Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body.
#### Liver Disease
Liver disease doesn't always cause noticeable signs and symptoms. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do occur, 
they may include: Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice) Abdominal pain and swelling. Swelling in the legs and ankles.
			
#### Breast Cancer
Breast cancer can occur in women and rarely in men.Symptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, 
bloody discharge from the nipple and changes in the shape or texture of the nipple or breast.Its treatment depends 
on the stage of cancer. It may consist of chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy and surgery.
#### Stroke
A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel 
in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage,
long-term disability, or even death.
